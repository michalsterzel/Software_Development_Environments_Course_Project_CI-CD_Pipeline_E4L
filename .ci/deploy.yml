# Deployment CI Jobs
# Michal - Infrastructure, CI/CD, Orchestration
#
# DUMMY TEST MODE: This file is not included during dummy test phase.
# Real deployment jobs are disabled during dummy test to avoid dependencies on backend/frontend.
#
# These jobs will be restored once backend.yml and frontend.yml are uncommented:
# - deploy_staging (depends on backend_image, frontend_image)
# - test_staging (depends on deploy_staging)  
# - deploy_prod (depends on test_staging)
#
# During dummy test phase:
# - The .ci/deploy.yml include is commented out in .gitlab-ci.yml
# - Only dummy jobs in .gitlab-ci.yml are executed
# - Dummy jobs test infrastructure with nginx:alpine placeholder images
#
# To restore real deployment jobs:
# 1. Uncomment .ci/backend.yml and .ci/frontend.yml in .gitlab-ci.yml
# 2. Uncomment .ci/deploy.yml in .gitlab-ci.yml
# 3. Comment out or remove dummy jobs from .gitlab-ci.yml
