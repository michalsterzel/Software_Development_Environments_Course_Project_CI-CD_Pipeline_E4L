# DUMMY TEST MODE: Real deployment jobs are disabled
# These will be re-enabled once backend.yml and frontend.yml are uncommented in .gitlab-ci.yml
#
# Real jobs that are temporarily disabled:
# - deploy_staging (depends on backend_image, frontend_image)
# - test_staging (depends on deploy_staging)
# - deploy_prod (depends on test_staging)
#
# Once backend and frontend teams implement real images:
# 1. Uncomment .ci/backend.yml and .ci/frontend.yml in .gitlab-ci.yml
# 2. Uncomment the jobs below in this file
# 3. Comment out or remove dummy jobs from .gitlab-ci.yml

# Placeholder: Real jobs will go here
# This file intentionally left with minimal content during dummy test phase
